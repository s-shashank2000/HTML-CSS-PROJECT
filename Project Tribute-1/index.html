          <h2>Early life and education</h2>
          <p>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to
            a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on
            Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
            Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and
            imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His
            father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between
            Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the
            youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.His ancestors
            had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous
            properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic
            group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent
            from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
            trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and
            from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland
            and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in
            1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and
            properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home.
            The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a
            young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager
            income.
